Interactive 3D N-Body Simulation
===============================

ðŸš§ COMING SOON! ðŸš§

This will be an interactive 3D version of the N-body simulation where you can:

- Place bodies in 3D space with mouse and keyboard
- Rotate and zoom the 3D view
- Set body properties with an intuitive interface
- Real-time simulation with beautiful 3D graphics
- VR support for immersive experience
- Advanced physics options

Features planned:
- OpenGL/ModernGL for smooth 3D rendering
- Intuitive 3D placement tools
- Camera controls (orbit, pan, zoom)
- Real-time lighting and shadows
- Particle effects for trails
- Advanced physics (relativistic effects, tidal forces)
- Export to popular 3D formats
- VR headset support

For now, enjoy the 2D interactive simulation!
Run: python interactive_2d_simulation.py

Expected release: Q3 2025
